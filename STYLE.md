# Style Guide 

## Language
All the code and comments should be written in the English language, using the US spelling

## Naming variables and functions
All variables and functions must be named using the ‘lowerCamelCase’ format

## Naming classes and view controllers
All classes and view controller must be named using the ‘UpperCamelCase’ format

## Using spacing between code
Empty lines must be inserted between every function, block of code, and between the initialization of the function and the first line of the function.

## Adding delegates to classes
Adding protocols will be done at the bottom of the class file, as ‘extension’. So, e.g. a class of type UIViewController will have only that type specification at top level.
